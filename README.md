# Vehicle Telemetry
Front end project for FedEx to monitor vehicle health

## Run Guide
To run the program navigate the folder VehicleTelemtry in windows powershell or terminal and run python3 -m http.server or python -m http.server, a localhost server will then be run on port 8000, and the site can be loaded to its home page by navigating to http://localhost:8000/vehicles.html

## Technologies Used
This project runs on a python server, which allows us to perform fetch operations on the dummy data we have created. Pages are made primarily with HTML and CSS, but bootstrap 5 classes are occasionally used to enchance elements. Vanilla Javascript is handling the dynamic display of elements.
